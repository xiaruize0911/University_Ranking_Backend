        "Description": "The University of California\u2014Berkeley is situated roughly 15 miles from San Francisco in what is known as the Bay Area. The public university, also commonly known as Berkeley or Cal, was founded in 1868. More than 70 percent of Berkeley students study at the undergraduate level. The university is divided into 14 colleges and schools, including the highly ranked Haas School of Business, College of Chemistry, College of Engineering, School of Public Health and School of Law. The academic calendar is semester-based and English is the language of instruction.\n\n UC\u2014Berkeley offers students around 350 degree programs. Some of the most popular majors for Berkeley undergraduates have included electrical engineering and computer science; economics; political science; business administration; and psychology. Around a quarter of undergraduate students live on campus, including some 95 percent of freshmen. Many graduate students live off campus, but they have the option to live in university-owned accommodations. Roughly 15 percent of the student body is international, and tuition and fees are higher for out-of-state students. Around 3,000 international scholars come to Berkeley each year in temporary teaching or research positions. Berkeley research is conducted not just within academic department labs and research centers but also in some of the school\u2019s museums and university-managed biological field stations. Research in botany, zoology, ecosystems and forestry is undertaken at the remote field station sites. Berkeley researchers discovered several of the elements on the periodic table, including californium and berkelium.",

Upward of 15,000 students attend Imperial, and tuition costs are higher for non-European Union students. Housing is guaranteed for first-year undergraduates, and a limited number of rooms are available for returning undergrads. On-campus graduate student housing is available for those studying at the Silwood Park campus, located around 25 miles west of Central London.\n\nThe university comprises four academic divisions focused on engineering, medicine, natural sciences and business. Imperial's academic calendar contains three terms \u2013 autumn, spring and summer \u2013 and the primary language of instruction is English. Among the university\u2019s research centers and groups are the Data Science Institute, the Institute of Global Health Innovation and the Centre for Hedge Fund Research. The university\u2019s Undergraduate Research Opportunities Programme each year provides around 400 students with hands-on research opportunities. The university's International Research Opportunities Programme sends Imperial undergraduates to partner universities in different countries \u2013 such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the U.S. and Seoul National University in South Korea \u2013 to conduct research for a minimum of eight weeks during the summer break. Imperial also has a history of research pioneers, including Alexander Fleming, who in 1945 discovered penicillin, an antibiotic that is now commonly used to treat bacterial infections.",

        "Description": "Princeton University was founded in 1746, making it one of the oldest higher education institutions in the U.S. The private university was originally called the College of New Jersey, but its name was changed to Princeton in 1896. The university is located in the town of Princeton, New Jersey, situated around 50 miles southwest of New York City. Some 8,000 students attend Princeton and nearly two-thirds of them study at the undergraduate level. Around 12 percent of undergraduates and more than 40 percent of graduate students at Princeton are international. Housing is guaranteed for undergraduate students for all four years, and nearly all undergraduates reside on campus. Princeton has six undergraduate residential colleges \u2013 communities that offer academic and social programs for students. A large number of graduate students, around 70 percent, also live in university housing.\n\nThe Ivy League university is made up of an undergraduate college, a graduate school, the School of Architecture, the highly ranked School of Engineering and Applied Science and the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. Princeton undergrads can choose from more than 30 academic concentrations. The primary language of instruction is English, and the academic calendar is semester-based. Research at Princeton is conducted across four broad disciplines: engineering and applied sciences, humanities, natural sciences and social sciences. The university is affiliated with two national laboratories, the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. The latter lab specializes in climate research and modeling.",

        "Description": "The California Institute of Technology, known as Caltech, was founded in 1891 as Throop University and received its current name in 1920. The science and engineering-focused school is located in Pasadena, California, roughly 11 miles northeast of Los Angeles. There are roughly 2,200 students at Caltech, with around 55 percent of them studying at the graduate level. The student-faculty ratio is very low, at 3:1. More than one-fourth of Caltech's total enrollment is international. The school\u2019s academic calendar is based on the quarter system and English is the language of instruction.\n\n Caltech has six academic divisions, many of which have highly ranked graduate programs: biology and biological engineering; chemistry and chemical engineering; engineering and applied science; geology and planetary sciences; humanities and social sciences; and physics, mathematics and astronomy. The university guarantees housing for all first-year undergraduate and graduate students. Instead of typical undergraduate residence halls like those found at many U.S. universities, there are eight undergraduate houses, each with its own government and special traditions. Newly admitted graduate students are given priority for housing in the on-campus Catalina Apartments. \n\n Around 80 percent of undergraduates participate in research during their time at Caltech. The university offers a Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships program where students write research proposals, collaborate with mentors and give presentations on their projects. Caltech has around 50 research institutes and centers, such as the Resnick Sustainability Institute and the Tectonics Observatory. Additionally, the university operates NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a center for robotic exploration of the solar system that engages both faculty and students.",

        "Description": "The University of British Columbia is a public institution located in the Canadian province of British Columbia. The university was established in 1908 and opened in 1915. It has two main campuses \u2013 the Vancouver campus and the Okanagan campus located in Kelowna. The Vancouver campus is the larger of the two, accommodating more than 85 percent of UBC students. In a recent year, 23 percent of students at the Vancouver campus and around 13 percent at the Okanagan campus were international. Tuition costs at UBC vary by degree program and are higher for international students. University housing is guaranteed for first-year UBC undergraduates, and newly admitted international students who are second-year undergrads receive housing priority too. Housing is also available for returning undergraduate and graduate students. \n\nThe Vancouver campus offers more than two dozen academic divisions, while the Okanagan campus has eight. The academic calendars for both campuses include two-term winter and summer sessions, although the summer session is optional. The primary language of instruction at UBC is English. First-year international students can opt to enroll in the Vantage One program at UBC's Vantage College, which aims to help students improve their English, in part by stretching their first year of study from eight to 11 months. Following completion, students transition into the second year of their UBC degree program. Examples of UBC research facilities include Canada\u2019s national TRIUMF subatomic physics laboratory, the Centre for Sustainable Food Systems at UBC Farm and the Institute for Healthy Living and Chronic Disease Prevention.",

        "Description": "Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin is a public institution in Germany that was founded in 1810. The university\u2019s campuses include Campus Adlershof, home to the natural sciences; Campus Mitte, where the arts and humanities are based, as well as law, economics and business, and theology; and Campus Nord, the university\u2019s hub for the life sciences. In a recent year, roughly half of the university's students were pursuing bachelor\u2019s degrees. Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t does not charge students for tuition. Instead, students pay a relatively low semester fee, which is generally the case at public universities in Germany. Some student housing is available through Studentenwerk, a public organization that manages various services for university students in the region.\n\nThe university comprises many academic divisions, including faculties of arts and humanities, economics and business administration, law, life sciences, mathematics and natural sciences, medicine, social sciences and theology. The primary language of instruction at Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t is German, and the university\u2019s academic calendar is semester-based. The university's medical school, Charite \u2013 Medical University of Berlin, is jointly operated with the Free University of Berlin. In a recent year, nearly 7,000 students were enrolled at Charite. Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t has cooperation agreements of varying types with more than 190 institutions around the world. For example, the university has teaching and research partnerships with the National University of Singapore, Princeton University in the U.S. and Brazil's Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo. The university has several major interdisciplinary research centers, such as the August Boeckh Centre for Antiquity and the Georg-Simmel Center for Metropolitan Studies.",

The university has four locations, and its main\u00a0campus is the Utrecht Science Park - De Uithof campus, situated\u00a0east of the Utrecht city center. Around 30,000 students attend the university, and tuition costs are higher for students from non-European Union and\u00a0non-European Economic Area countries, with the exception of Swiss and Surinamese students. Students can apply for housing in dormitories managed by an outside organization.\n\nThe university has seven main academic divisions: geosciences; humanities; law, economics and governance; medicine; science; social and behavioral sciences; and veterinary medicine. Additionally, there are two university colleges \u2013 University College Roosevelt and University College Utrecht \u2013 focused on liberal arts education for undergraduates as well as a center for teaching and learning. All told, the university offers around 45 bachelor\u2019s degree programs and more than 130 master\u2019s degree programs. Dutch is the primary language of instruction, though a handful of bachelor\u2019s programs and more than 80 master's programs are English-taught. Examples of master's programs taught in English are those in banking and finance, the cultural history of modern Europe and religious studies.\n\nMuch of the research at Utrecht University is structured around the four strategic themes of dynamics of youth, institutions for open societies, life sciences and sustainability. Some of the university\u2019s research institutes are the Copernicus Institute of Sustainable Development and the Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research.",

The primary language of instruction at the school is Swedish, but several degree programs, known as global bachelor's and global master's programs, are offered in English. Some of the English-taught master's offerings are programs in bioentrepreneurship, global health and public health sciences. The institution offers a three-day intensive Swedish language class to all new international students. Research is prevalent at the Karolinska Institute and covers nine main focus areas, which include cancer and hematology, epidemiology and public health sciences, and neuroscience. More than 40 percent of the academic medical research conducted in Sweden occurs at the school. Since 1901, a committee of 50 Karolinska Institute professors has selected the recipients of the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine.",

        "Description": "Heidelberg University is a public institution that was founded in 1386, earning it the title of Germany's oldest university. The school is located in Heidelberg in the state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and is spread across three campuses. Just less than 20 percent of the total student body is international. The university does not charge students for tuition \u2013 this is generally the case with public universities in Germany. Students instead pay relatively low semester fees. Some student housing is available through Studierendenwerk, a public organization that provides accommodations and other services to university students.\n\nThe university has a dozen academic divisions: theology, law, philosophy, modern languages, economics and social sciences, behavioral and cultural studies, math and computer science, chemistry and earth sciences, physics and astronomy, biosciences and two medical faculties. The school's academic calendar is semester-based, and the primary language of instruction is German. A few master's degree programs are taught in English, including programs in American studies, economics and international health. The university collaborates with several outside organizations on research activities, including the German Cancer Research Centre, the European Laboratory for Molecular Biology and the Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies. One research achievement associated with Heidelberg University is the creation of the Bunsen burner. The professor for whom the now-common chemistry device is named taught at Heidelberg and, with others, invented the burner.",

        "Description": "McGill University is a public institution that was founded in 1821 and is located in Quebec, Canada. The university has two campuses: the downtown campus in Montreal and the Macdonald campus in Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue. The two campuses are approximately 20 miles apart. The primary language of instruction is English, although in a recent year around 20 percent of university students said French was their mother tongue. In fact, around half of the population of Montreal speaks French as a first language. Around one-fourth of the student body is international, with students hailing from more than 150 countries. University housing is available for undergraduate and graduate students on both campuses.\n\nThe university is made up of 10 faculties and schools \u2013 agricultural and environmental sciences, arts, dentistry, education, engineering, law, management, medicine, music and science \u2013 that offer around 300 programs of study. Around two-thirds of the university's students study at the undergraduate level. Tuition costs are higher for international students, and McGill's academic calendar is based on a semester system. The university is affiliated with multiple teaching hospitals, and its medical school is the oldest in Canada. Research at the university takes place at more than 40 McGill research centers \u2013 such as the McGill Centre for Bioinformatics, the Centre on Population Dynamics and the Centre for Intellectual Property Policy \u2013 and at other affiliated institutes and hospitals. The creation of the first artificial blood cell is among the research achievements associated with the university.",

The university is located in Shanghai, China, and is spread across four sites: the Handan, Jiangwan, Fenglin and Zhangjiang campuses. More than 30,000 students are enrolled at Fudan University. Undergraduate students reside on campus in one of five residential colleges \u2013 Zhide, Tengfei, Keqing, Renzhong or Xide \u2013 for all four years of their studies. Each college is named after a former university leader and has its own dean and student management\u00a0board. Housing is also available for graduate students.\n\nIn all, Fudan University offers around 70 undergraduate majors, as well as almost 250 master\u2019s degree programs and some 150 doctoral programs. The undergraduate programs are structured according to a liberal arts core curriculum.\u00a0The university\u2019s academic calendar is semester-based, and tuition costs are higher for international students. The primary language of instruction is Chinese, but a handful of degree programs\u00a0are taught in English.\u00a0In 2000, Fudan University merged with Shanghai Medical University, and the university is affiliated with 11 hospitals. The university has been a major participant in national research for much of its history; research bodies at the university include national key labs for genetic engineering, surface physics and medical neurobiology. Fudan's Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program supports around 700 undergraduates' research work each year. And when students need a break from their studies, they can choose from more than 300 student clubs to participate in, including almost 20 international student groups.",

USTC, as the university is sometimes called, is situated in Hefei, the capital of China\u2019s Anhui province, and has five campuses within the city located relatively close to each other. Around 1.5 percent of the student body hails from abroad. Many of the university's international students receive financial support from one of three sources: the USTC Scholarship, the Chinese Government Scholarship or a fellowship that the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the World Academy of Sciences offers. All three types of aid cover tuition and provide a stipend for other education-related costs. University housing is available for both undergraduate and graduate students.\n\nUSTC has more than a dozen schools, many of which are devoted to the sciences, but the university also has academic divisions focused on subjects such as public affairs and business. Additionally, the USTC School of the Gifted Young offers instruction for advanced students. The university follows a semester-based academic calendar. The primary language of instruction is Chinese, though some master\u2019s and most doctoral programs are also offered in English. More than 70 percent of undergraduate students participate in USTC\u2019s Research Program for Undergraduates, which takes place at university labs and Chinese Academy of Sciences research institutes. Among the research labs that USTC operates are the National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory, the Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at the Microscale and the State Key Laboratory of Fire Science.",

The university has three locations in the German state of Bavaria \u2013 downtown Munich, Garching and Weihenstephan. The Garching campus, located north of Munich, has the largest enrollment and is home to TUM's natural sciences and technology divisions. In general, students do not pay tuition at the university but rather pay semester fees. TUM does not have its own student housing, though accommodations managed by outside organizations are available.\n\nThe university has 13 academic divisions: architecture; chemistry; civil, geo and environmental engineering; education; electrical and computer engineering; informatics; life sciences; management; math; mechanical engineering; medicine; physics; and sport and health sciences. In all, the university offers more than 150 degree programs, and the primary language of instruction is German. However, TUM offers more than three dozen programs\u00a0that are taught completely in English as well as a number of bilingual programs, most of which are at the master's level. The university\u2019s academic calendar is semester-based. The university has a number of research centers, including the Munich Center for Technology in Society, the Walter Schottky Institut for the study of nanotechnology and nanomaterials and the Hans Eisenmann-Zentrum for agricultural sciences.\u00a0The Erlenmeyer flask, a piece of equipment commonly\u00a0found in chemistry labs that is\u00a0used to measure and store\u00a0liquids, was named after one of TUM's founding professors.",

        "Description": "The Australian National University was founded in 1946. The public institution\u2019s main Acton Campus is located in Australia\u2019s capital city, Canberra. Other university sites include the Mount Stromlo Observatory and the Siding Spring Observatory, both associated with the ANU Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics.\u00a0Tuition costs vary by subject and\u00a0are generally higher for international students. University housing is available for both undergraduate and graduate students; in a recent year, more than 20 percent of the university's student body lived on campus. A year of housing is guaranteed for first-year undergraduate students from outside the Canberra region. \n\nThe university has seven colleges: arts and social sciences; Asia and the Pacific; business and economics; engineering and computer science; law; medicine, biology and environment; and physical and mathematical sciences. The language of instruction is English, and the university\u2019s academic calendar is semester-based. The university has student exchange partnerships with upward of\u00a0150 universities in more than\u00a030 countries, including the University of Montreal in Canada and the Technical University of Munich in Germany.\u00a0As is true at other Australian universities, undergraduate students can enroll in\u00a0degree programs that place them on a path to earn an honors degree \u2013 a more advanced credential than a bachelor's degree. Honors degree programs\u00a0focus heavily on research.\u00a0Some of the Australian National University's many research facilities are the John Curtin School of Medical Research,\u00a0the Climate Change Institute and the National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health.",

        "Description": "The University of California\u2014Santa Barbara, or UCSB, is a public university that traces its roots back to 1891. The school became part of the University of California system in 1944. The West Coast university's campus overlooks the Pacific Ocean and is about 100 miles northwest of Los Angeles. In a recent year, the institution enrolled more than 20,000 students, and upward of 85 percent of them were studying at the undergraduate level. Top countries of origin for UCSB's international students that year included China, India and South Korea. Non-California residents pay a supplemental tuition at UCSB. University housing is available and guaranteed for four years for new freshmen undergrads and for two years for transfer students.\n\nUCSB has five colleges and schools \u2013 creative studies, engineering, letters and science, environmental science and management, and education \u2013 as well as a graduate division. In all, the institution offers more than 200 majors, degrees and credentials. The university follows a quarter-based academic calendar, and English is the primary language of instruction. UCSB has around a dozen national research institutes and centers on its campus, including the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics, the Materials Research Laboratory and the Institute for Collaborative Biotechnologies, which the U.S. Army supports. More than 50 percent of the university's undergraduate students conduct research, some through programs such as the Faculty Research Assistance Program, which pairs students with UCSB researchers in their fields of interest and allows them to earn credit for their work.",

        "Description": "Lund University is a public institution that was founded in 1666. Its main campus is in Lund, Sweden, with additional campuses in Helsingborg, Ljungbyhed and Malm\u00f6. The Lund campus is roughly 40 miles west of Copenhagen, Denmark. International students at the university hail from more than 130 countries. Tuition is free for students from countries in the European Union and European Economic Area as well as Switzerland. International students from outside these areas generally are charged tuition. Some university housing is available for both undergraduate and graduate students.\n\nThe university has eight main academic divisions \u2013 engineering, science, law, social sciences, medicine, humanities and theology, economics and management, and fine and performing arts \u2013 and a school of aviation. In all, more than 75 bachelor\u2019s programs and around 220 master\u2019s programs are available. The university follows a semester-based academic calendar. Lund University students generally take one course at a time, with the exception of engineering students who usually take two, and a course can last anywhere from two to 20 weeks. The primary language of instruction at the undergraduate level is Swedish, but a handful of English-taught bachelor\u2019s programs are offered. There are many master's programs taught in English, including ones in economics, finance and international human law. Some of Lund University's research institutes and centers are the Lund University Centre for Sustainability Studies, the Lund University Diabetes Centre and the Max IV Laboratory, used for synchrotron radiation research.",

        "Description": "The University of California\u2014Santa Cruz, or UCSC, is a public institution that was founded in 1965. The school is located along California's coast, around 75 miles south of San Francisco. The school is also just south of Silicon Valley, which means many research, internship and employment opportunities are nearby for students. More than 17,000 students attended the university in a recent year, and around 90 percent of them were studying at the undergraduate level. Non-California residents pay a supplemental tuition. Around half of the UCSC student body lives on campus, and housing options include the university's 10 undergraduate residential colleges. All undergrads become affiliated with one of the residential colleges, each of which offers academic support services and social activities. Housing is guaranteed for four years for undergraduate international students who enter as freshmen.\n\nThe university offers studies in the arts, humanities, physical and biological sciences, social sciences and engineering. In all, UCSC offers around 60 undergraduate majors as well as graduate studies in approximately 40 fields.

        "Description": "Uppsala University is a public institution that was founded in 1477. It is located primarily in Uppsala, Sweden, a city around 45 miles north of Stockholm. In addition to facilities located in different areas of Uppsala, the university has a campus located on the Swedish island of Gotland. Some programs only available at the Gotland campus are conservation as well as game design. Students from European Union and European Economic Area countries and Switzerland do not pay tuition. But international students from outside these areas are charged tuition, which varies by academic discipline, with medical, science and technology-related studies costing more. The university does not provide housing, except to exchange students and tuition-paying master\u2019s students. Outside housing organizations manage the residences for the school.\n\nThe university offers studies in the humanities and social sciences, medical and pharmaceutical, and science and technology disciplines. The school\u2019s academic calendar is semester-based. The university\u2019s medical programs are affiliated with Uppsala University Hospital, where clinical training and research take place. The primary language of instruction is Swedish for undergraduate programs, but a number of both Swedish- and English-taught master's programs are available. All of the university's international master's offerings are English-taught, including programs in computer science, entrepreneurship, and peace and conflict studies. The university has many research centers, including the Uppsala Centre for Russian and Eurasian Studies, the Centre for Natural Disaster Science and the Uppsala RNA Research Center.",

The Canadian university's main campus is in a suburban neighborhood of Hamilton, Ontario, near the western edge of Lake Ontario and not far from the U.S. border. Other campuses are located in downtown Hamilton, Burlington, Kitchener-Waterloo and Niagara. The university's international students hail from more than 75 countries, and its full-time faculty members come from more than 55. Tuition costs are higher for non-Canadian students. University-operated student housing is available, with options including themed living communities such as an all-female community, a healthy active living community and a global perspectives community.\n\nThe university has six main academic divisions \u2013 engineering, health sciences, humanities, science, social sciences and the DeGroote School of Business \u2013 and the primary language of instruction is English. McMaster University also has an arts and science program that enrolls around 60 students each year and offers a more interdisciplinary undergraduate experience. The academic calendar for McMaster undergraduates is semester-based and includes an optional spring/summer term. The graduate-level academic calendar has three terms: fall, winter and summer. Some of the university's more than 60 research centers and institutes are the Centre for Health Economics and Policy Analysis, the McMaster eBusiness Research Centre and the Canadian Centre for Electron Microscopy. The university also has its own nuclear reactor, which is used for research. An interesting fact about the university is that one-fifth of Albert Einstein's brain sits in a jar in one of the school's labs where a McMaster neuroscientist studies it and other specimens.",

        "Description": "The University of Milan is a public institution that was founded in 1924. The Italian university\u2019s main campus is situated in a historical complex called Ca\u2019 Granda in the Milan city center. Additional facilities are in the university quarter, or Citt\u00e0 Studi, and in a few other locations both in and outside Milan. Tuition costs are the same for Italian and international students but vary based on field of study. A limited amount of university student housing is available for students who come from outside the Milan area.\n\nThe institution offers studies in a variety of academic areas: agricultural and food sciences; exercise and sports sciences; humanities; law; linguistic and cultural mediation sciences; medicine; pharmacy; political, economic and social sciences; science and technology; and veterinary medicine. In all, the university offers around 65 bachelor's programs and a similar number of master's programs. The university\u2019s academic calendar is semester-based, though all departments may not have the same start and end dates for their courses. Italian is the primary language of instruction, but the university does offer some English-taught degree programs, most of which are at the graduate level. Examples of programs taught in English include master's programs in economics and finance as well as sustainable development. Research centers at the university include the Centre for Gender & Equality in Research and Science and the Centre of Excellence on Neurodegenerative Diseases. The university also has three botanical gardens, one dating back to 1777, that are used for education and research activities.",

        "Description": "The University of Bonn is a public institution that was founded in 1818. The university has facilities located throughout Bonn, a city in western Germany near the Rhine River. The city was the birthplace of the late composer Ludwig van Beethoven, and today is home to several United Nations organizations. In a recent year, more than 30,000 students were enrolled at the university and around 12 percent of the total student body was international, with students hailing from around 135 countries. The University of Bonn generally does not charge students for tuition, though students do pay a relatively low social fee each semester. This fee covers a public transportation pass, library access and other student services. Some student housing is available through the public organization Studierendenwerk Bonn.\n\nThe university has seven main academic divisions \u2013 agriculture, arts, Catholic theology, law and economics, mathematics and natural sciences, medicine and Protestant theology \u2013 and follows a semester-based academic calendar. German is the primary language of instruction, though some English-taught or bilingual degree programs are available, mostly at the graduate level. Some of the English-taught master's options include programs in computer sciences, economics and mathematics. The university also offers language courses to help international students learn everyday German. Research bodies at the university include the Laboratory for Experimental Economics, the Bethe Center for Theoretical Physics and the Franz Joseph D\u00f6lger-Institut, focused on the study of late antiquity. The university has established partnerships with more than 70 global universities, including the University of Tokyo, the Australian National University and the Wageningen University and Research Center in the Netherlands.",

        "Description": "The University of Gothenburg is a public institution that was founded in 1954, although the roots of one of its predecessor schools go back as far as 1891. The university has facilities located throughout Gothenburg, Sweden, one of the Scandinavian country's largest cities. Students from non-European Union and non-European Economic Area countries pay tuition, while those from EU and EEA countries are exempt. In a recent year, the university's international students hailed from around 70 countries. The school only offers student housing to exchange students, but other students can apply for housing through outside organizations such as SGS Studentbost\u00e4der, a nonprofit.\n\nThe university, which follows a semester-based academic calendar, has eight main academic divisions: science; arts; fine, applied and performing arts; social sciences; business, economics and law; education; information technology; and the Sahlgrenska Academy, which is focused on health sciences. The university engages in various collaborations with the nearby Chalmers University of Technology, including three shared academic departments and an agreement that enables master's students at one school to enroll in courses at the other. The primary language of instruction for undergraduate programs is Swedish, though a number of undergraduate and master's courses are taught in English. Fully English-taught degree programs, mostly at the graduate level, are also offered. International students can get a taste of the local language by enrolling in free Swedish courses at the university. Some of the university's research facilities include a herbarium, the Sven Lov\u00e9n Centre for Marine Infrastructure and the Swedish NMR Centre, which is focused on nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.",

        "Description": "Yonsei University is a private institution that traces its roots back to 1885, when Christian missionaries founded a hospital that eventually became part of the university. The university as it currently exists was created in 1957. The South Korean school has multiple campuses, with the Sinchon campus in Seoul as its main location. Other locations include the International Campus in Songdo, which opened in 2010, and the Wonju Campus. Tuition costs at Yonsei are the same for domestic and international students and vary by academic subject. University housing is available for both undergraduate and graduate students. Yonsei freshmen spend their first year on the International Campus and participate in the university's residential college system, in which students become members of one of 12 houses that offer educational and social activities.\n\nThe university has numerous academic divisions, including colleges of liberal arts, business and economics, science, engineering and theology, among others. The primary language of instruction at Yonsei is Korean, but some English-taught degree programs are offered.\u00a0For instance, programs at the university\u2019s Underwood International College, a liberal arts institution, are entirely English-taught, as are the programs at the Graduate School of International Studies. Another English-taught offering is the Yonsei Global MBA program. The university has a semester-based academic calendar. University research institutes include the Institute of Convergence Science, the Institute for Poverty Alleviation and International Development and the Institute of Korean Studies.",

In a recent year, around 23,000 students attended the university. Kyoto University has three campuses \u2013 the main Yoshida campus and the Uji and Katsura campuses \u2013 as well as facilities located in other areas of Japan, such as field stations for research. Tuition costs are the same for international and domestic students, and some university student housing is available.\n\nIn all, 10 academic divisions at the university offer undergraduate degrees: integrated human studies, letters, education, law, economics, science, medicine, pharmaceutical sciences, engineering and agriculture. Undergrads take courses in the liberal arts and sciences, as well as in more specialized areas. Kyoto University also has 18 graduate schools, including a school of Asian and African area studies as well as a school of management. The graduate schools offer master's, doctoral and professional degree programs.\n\nThe university\u2019s academic calendar is semester-based, and the primary language of instruction is Japanese. However, some English-taught programs are available, mostly at the graduate level, including a program in international environmental management and an MBA program. The university\u2019s Education Center for Japanese Language and Culture offers 15-week supplementary Japanese language classes for international students and researchers. Some of the research institutes at the university are the Institute for Frontier Medical Sciences, the Disaster Prevention Research Institute and the Primate Research Institute.",

        "Description": "The University of Montreal is a public institution that traces its roots back to 1878. Initially a branch of the Universit\u00e9 Laval de Qu\u00e9bec, it became an independent institution in 1919. The university is affiliated with two other schools: Polytechnique Montr\u00e9al, an engineering school, and HEC Montr\u00e9al, a business school. The university and its affiliated schools are located in Montreal, Quebec \u2013 one of the most populous metropolitan areas in Canada. Around one-fourth of the student body across all three institutions studies at the graduate level. The university offers housing for full-time undergraduate and graduate students.\n\nUdeM, as the school is sometimes called, has more than a dozen academic divisions that span the social, natural and health sciences, as well as arts and humanities disciplines. The primary language of instruction is French, although several graduate programs \u2013 such as doctoral programs in biochemistry, neurosciences and pharmacology \u2013 accept English-speaking students. Tutoring, workshops and other resources are available for students who want to improve their French language skills. The university\u2019s academic calendar is based on a semester system, and tuition costs are higher for international students. The Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, the Cyberjustice Laboratory and the International Centre for Comparative Criminology are among the university\u2019s many research units. Some University of Montreal researchers collaborate on projects with institutions located in other parts of the world, primarily in France, Germany, Italy, the U.K. and the U.S.",

        "Description": "The University of Waterloo is a public institution that was founded in 1957. The Canadian university's main campus is in Waterloo, Ontario, not far from several of the Great Lakes and the U.S. border. The university also has satellite campuses in nearby Cambridge, Kitchener and Stratford. More than 30,000 students attend the university. Tuition is generally higher for international students, though a handful of graduate programs charge domestic and international students the same rate. University housing is available for both undergraduate and graduate students.\n\nThe university has six main academic divisions: applied health sciences, arts, engineering, environment, math and science. The main campus has four affiliated university colleges \u2013 Conrad Grebel University College, Renison University College, St. Jerome\u2019s University and St. Paul's University College \u2013 where students can pursue a Waterloo degree in a smaller academic community. The language of instruction is English, and the university's academic calendar consists of three terms. Many of the university's students participate in a co-op program that allows them to alternate academic terms with terms spent in in the workforce. More than 120 of Waterloo's undergraduate programs offer a co-op option. The university also offers joint degree programs with global universities in several countries, including China's Tsinghua University, Taiwan's National Chiao Tung University and the U.K.'s University of Warwick. A sampling of the university's research institutions includes the Water Institute, the Waterloo Centre for Automotive Research and the Mike & Ophelia Lazaridis Quantum-Nano Centre.",

        "Description": "The University of Vienna is a public institution that was founded in 1365, making it the oldest university in the German-speaking world. The Austrian university is located in Vienna, the country's capital. The school does not have one central campus but instead has facilities located throughout the city, primarily in the first and ninth districts. Students pay relatively low tuition each semester as well as a small student union fee. The tuition costs are higher for some students from outside the European Union and European Economic Area. The University of Vienna does not operate its own student housing.\n\nThe university has numerous academic divisions, including those focused on business, economics and statistics; computer science; historical and cultural studies; psychology; and life sciences. Additionally, the university has centers focused on translation studies, sport science, molecular biology and teacher education. In all, the University of Vienna offers around 175 degree programs, including several joint degree programs that provide students the opportunity to study at more than one university. The university follows a semester-based academic calendar, and the primary language of instruction is German. However, a handful of degree programs are taught in English, including master\u2019s programs in communication science, economics and computer science. One of the university's research centers is the\u00a0Vienna Center for Quantum Science and Technology, which is jointly operated with\u00a0the Vienna University of Technology and the Austrian Academy of Sciences.",

        "Description": "The University of Turin, sometimes called Unito, is a public institution that was founded in 1404. It is located in Turin, Italy, which was the host city for the 2006 Winter Olympics. Turin is in the Piedmont region of northwest Italy, roughly 90 miles southwest of Milan. The university has seven campuses, five of which are located in the city center. The other two campuses are at the outskirts of the city. Tuition at the university costs the same for Italian and international students. EDISU Piedmont, a public organization, manages the university housing, which is available for both undergrad and graduate students.\n\nThe university has six schools: agriculture and veterinary medicine; management and economics; medicine; science of nature; law, politics and social-economic sciences; and human sciences. In a recent year, the institution offered more than 65 three-year bachelor's programs and 75 two-year master's programs. The academic calendar is semester-based, with exceptions for a few programs. The primary language of instruction at the University of Turin is Italian, but a handful of degree programs are taught in English, including a bachelor\u2019s in business management and master\u2019s degree programs in fields such as economics and molecular biotechnology. The institution offers Italian language courses for students, visiting professors and researchers. The university\u2019s many research centers and institutes include the Molecular Biotechnology Center, the Centre for Nanostructured Interfaces and Surfaces and the Interdisciplinary Research Institute on Sustainability.",

It\u00a0is located in Barcelona, Spain, and has three campuses \u2013 the Cituadella, Poblenou and Mar campuses \u2013 located near one another in the heart of the city. The university\u2019s namesake, Pompeu Fabra, is credited with standardizing the modern Catalan language during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In a recent year, more than 13,000 students attended the university. Some student housing is available near the school's campuses, though\u00a0UPF does not manage it directly.\n\nUPF has three broad academic focus areas: social sciences and humanities, health and life sciences, and communications and information technologies. The university is also affiliated with the UPF Group, a collection of specialized teaching and research institutions, including the UPF Barcelona School of Management, the Elisava School of Design and the Mar Nursing School. UPF follows a trimester-based academic calendar. In a recent year, around 20 percent of the UPF faculty was international. Three languages are spoken in UPF classrooms: Catalan, Spanish and English. The primary language of instruction for undergraduates is Catalan, though some subjects are taught in English. Additionally, some graduate-level programs are taught entirely in English, including master's programs in political philosophy and biomedical research.\n\nThe university has numerous research groups, including groups focused on human genetics research, political behavior and wireless communications. UPF is also affiliated with several research centers that are UPF Group members, including the Centre for Regenerative Medicine in Barcelona and the Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute.",

        "Description": "Korea University is a private institution that was founded in 1905. Originally called Bosung College, the university received its current name in 1946. The South Korean university has two campuses \u2013 one in Seoul and another in Sejong \u2013 located about 80 miles from each other. The Seoul campus is the larger of the two; more than three-quarters of the university\u2019s students study there. Tuition is the same for domestic and international students, and some university- and government-sponsored scholarships are available for non-Korean students. University housing is available, and residences for international students include the CJ International House and the Anam Global House. Foreign students can participate in a buddy program and a language partner program to help them better acclimate to life on campus.\n\nThe university has undergraduate colleges and graduate schools that offer studies in a variety of subjects, including the liberal arts and sciences. It also has professional graduate schools, such as a law school, business school and school of medicine. The university is affiliated with the Ansan, Guro and Anam hospitals. Korean is the primary language of instruction, though some courses are offered in English. The academic divisions that offer the most English-taught courses are the Division of International Studies and the Korea University Business School. The university\u2019s academic calendar is semester-based. Korea University\u2019s research institutes include the KU Biodefense Research Institute, the Brain and Motivation Research Institute and the Research Institute for Information and Communication Technology.",

The institution is spread across five sites \u2013 the Katahira, Kawauchi, Aobayama, Seiryo and Amamiya campuses \u2013 in the city of Sendai, Japan. Sendai is located around 225 miles north of Tokyo. In a recent year, more than 17,000 students attended the university and upward of 60 percent of them studied at the undergraduate level. In the same year, Tohoku University's international students hailed from around 90 countries. Tuition costs are the same for domestic and international students, and some university housing is available.\n\nTohoku University has 10 schools for undergraduates: arts and letters, education, law, economics, science, medicine, dentistry, pharmacy and pharmaceutical sciences, engineering and agriculture. The university also has 17 graduate schools and three professional graduate schools in law, public policy and accounting. The university\u2019s academic calendar is semester-based. The primary language of instruction is Japanese, but the university offers three undergraduate degree programs \u2013 in molecular chemistry, marine biology, and mechanical and aerospace engineering \u2013 and roughly a dozen graduate programs in English. Research institutes at Tohoku University include the Institute for Materials Research, the Research Institute of Electrical Communication and the Institute of Fluid Science. The university also established the Tohoku University Institute for Disaster Reconstruction and Regeneration Research after an earthquake and tsunami severely damaged the school in 2011. Through this institute, the university continues to help affected communities recover from the natural disaster.",

        "Description": "Osaka University, sometimes called OU, is a Japanese national university that was founded in 1931 as the sixth imperial university of Japan. It is located in Osaka, Japan, and has three main campuses \u2013 Suita, Toyonaka and Minoh. In 2007, the university merged with the Osaka University of Foreign Studies. Upward of 23,000 students attended the institution in a recent year, and around two-thirds of them studied at the undergraduate level. That same year, roughly 9 percent of the student body was international. Tuition costs are the same for domestic and international students, and university housing is available for both undergraduate and graduate students.\n\nThe research-oriented university has 11 undergraduate schools: human sciences, foreign studies, law, letters, economics, science, medicine, dentistry, pharmaceutical sciences, engineering and engineering science. The university also has more than a dozen graduate schools, including a school of language and culture, school of information science and technology, and a school of frontier biosciences. The institution\u2019s academic calendar is semester-based, and the primary language of instruction for undergraduates is Japanese, though a few English-taught undergraduate degree programs are available. English-language instruction is a bit more common at the graduate level. The university boasts multiple libraries, including a life science library, a science and engineering library and an international studies library. Osaka University's research institutes include the Research Institute for Microbial Diseases and the Joining and Welding Research Institute.",

        "Description": "The Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg traces its roots back to 1538, though it was not until 2009 that three separate universities merged to form the institution as it exists today. The university is a public institution located in the city of Strasbourg in northeastern France, near the country\u2019s border with Germany. In a recent year, more than 46,500 students attended the multicampus institution, and around 36 percent of them pursued bachelor\u2019s degrees. Roughly one-fifth of the total student body was international during that same year. The cost to attend the university is the same for native and international degree-seeking\u00a0students, and student housing is available through the public organization CROUS.\n\nStudies at the university are offered across five broad academic disciplines: arts, literature and languages; law, economics, management, political and social sciences; social sciences and humanities; science and technology; and health. The primary language of instruction is French, but several graduate-level degrees are taught partially in English. The university follows a semester-based academic calendar. The Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg belongs to a network of five universities located in the Upper Rhine Valley called EUCOR. These universities \u2013 Strasbourg and the Universit\u00e9 de Haute-Alsace in France, the University of Freiburg and the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany and the University of Basel in Switzerland \u2013 cooperate on joint academic and research programs. Students at these universities can take courses at other EUCOR institutions without having to pay additional fees. Among the Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg\u2019s research units are the Centre for the Analysis of Antique Religious Rhetoric, the Institute of Supramolecular Science and Engineering and the Institute of Cellular and Integrative Neurosciences.",

        "Description": "Nagoya University is a Japanese national university that traces its roots back to 1871, when its predecessor medical school was established. In 1939, the institution became the last imperial university of Japan. The university is located in Nagoya \u2013 the capital of the Aichi prefecture in Japan. It also has satellite campuses in other countries, including Cambodia, Mongolia and Vietnam, which offer programs for doctoral students.\u00a0In a recent year, more than 15,500 students attended Nagoya University and more than 60 percent of them studied at the undergraduate level. The same year, roughly 10 percent of the Nagoya student body was international. The university charges domestic and international students the same tuition rates\u00a0and has several dormitories for international students located on or near campus.\n\nNagoya University has nine schools \u2013 letters, education, law, economics, informatics and sciences, medicine, science, engineering and agricultural sciences \u2013 as well as more than a dozen\u00a0graduate schools and several institutes.\u00a0The primary language of instruction is Japanese, but some undergraduate and graduate-level programs, called Global 30 International Programs, are taught entirely in English.\u00a0These include undergraduate programs in chemistry and automotive engineering and graduate-level programs in medical science as well as\u00a0economics and business administration.\u00a0The university\u00a0uses a semester-based academic calendar.\u00a0Some of the university\u2019s research centers and institutes\u00a0are the Institute of Transformative Bio-Molecules, the Institute of Innovation for Future Society and the Kobayashi-Maskawa Institute for the Origin of Particles and the Universe.",

The university provides students with free housing in several dormitories \u2013 Collegio Faedo, Collegio Carducci, Collegio Timpano and Collegio Fermi \u2013 as well as a residence for doctoral students\u00a0in Florence. If there is not space for graduate students in the dormitories, they are given a stipend to pay for outside accommodations. Students at the Scuola Normale can also\u00a0receive free meals.\n\nThe university has a handful of academic divisions: humanities, mathematical and natural sciences, and the Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences, which focuses on doctoral studies\u00a0and is located in Florence. Students enrolled at the institution take courses from both the Scuola Normale and the University of Pisa. After three years of study, students receive a degree from the University of Pisa as well as a specialized diploma from Scuola. After two additional years of study, students can earn a master's degree from the University of Pisa and another specialized diploma from Scuola. The primary language of instruction is Italian, and classes are commonly taught in\u00a0seminar style.\u00a0The university\u2019s research bodies include the Centre for Data Processing of Texts and Images in the Literary Tradition; the Bio@SNS Laboratory, focused on the study of the brain; and the Laboratory of Sciences of Antiquity.",

        "Description": "Pohang University of Science and Technology, also known as POSTECH, is a private institution that was founded in 1986. The science- and engineering-focused university is located in the city of Pohang, South Korea, approximately 250 miles southeast of the capital city, Seoul. In a recent year, upward of 3,000 students attended the university and approximately 40 percent of them studied at the undergraduate level. Tuition is the same for international and domestic students, and many POSTECH students receive university or government scholarships and grants. Additionally, new international graduate students at POSTECH receive a settlement allowance during their first semester to help cover relocation expenses. University student housing is available for both undergraduate- and graduate-level students.\n\nThe university has academic divisions that focus mainly on science, engineering and technology. Both Korean and English are spoken in POSTECH classrooms. In a recent year, around 85 percent of courses that counted toward undergraduate and graduate majors were offered in English. However, if students want to brush up on their Korean language skills, they can take classes through the POSTECH Korean Language Program. The university follows a semester-based academic calendar, with the school year beginning in March. One of the university\u2019s research facilities is the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory, the only synchrotron radiation accelerator in South Korea. POSTECH's Undergraduate Research Program provides funding for 40-60 students each year to participate in research activities for several months under faculty guidance. Undergraduates can also enroll in research-focused courses for academic credit.",

        "Description": "The University of Trieste is a public institution that traces its roots back to 1877 when it was initially started as the School of Commerce. The institution was officially founded as a university in 1924. Its main campus is in Trieste, Italy, a city located east of Venice and near the country's border with Slovenia. The university has other sites in Gorizia, Portogruaro and Pordenone, all in northeastern Italy. Tuition costs vary by academic subject but are the same for domestic and international students. Housing in student residence halls is available through an outside organization.\n\nThe university's 10 main academic divisions cover a variety of subjects: chemical and pharmaceutical sciences; economic, business, mathematical and statistical sciences; engineering and architecture; humanities; legal, language, interpreting and translation studies; life sciences; mathematics and geosciences; medicine, surgery and health sciences; physics; and political and social sciences. The primary language of instruction is Italian. However, program options are available for English speakers, including English-taught bachelor's degree programs in business and management, as well as a master's program in physics offered jointly with the University of Udine. For the most part, the university uses a semester-based academic calendar. The city of Trieste and the surrounding area are home to a number of research institutions \u2013 including the Elettra Synchrotron Light Laboratory and the AREA Science Park \u2013 and the university has partnerships with some of them.",

        "Description": "The University of Innsbruck is a public institution that was founded in 1669. The university is located in Innsbruck, Austria, in the Alps region. The institution has four main campuses \u2013 Innrain, Sport, Technik and Universit\u00e4tsstra\u00dfe. In a recent year, around 40 percent of the University of Innsbruck student body was international. Students from European Union and European Economic Area countries are not charged tuition, but students from outside these areas pay relatively low tuition costs. The university does not offer its own student housing.\n\nThe university has 16 main academic divisions that cover a variety of fields, including biology, economics and statistics, engineering science, management, and political science and sociology. Overall, the institution offers more than 100 different academic programs. The university used to have medical division, but in 2004 it became its own institution: the Medical University of Innsbruck. The university's primary language of instruction is German, but some English-taught programs are available, including master's programs in applied economics, physics and strategic management. The university follows a semester-based academic calendar.\n\nThe main research areas at the University of Innsbruck are alpine space \u2013 man and environment, cultural encounters \u2013 cultural conflicts, molecular biosciences, physics and scientific computing. Some of the research centers at the University of Innsbruck are focused on\u00a0Alpine infrastructure engineering, mountain agriculture, and migration and globalization. The university also has a botanical garden that is used for teaching and research; the garden was created in 1793 and is home to thousands of plant species.",

        "Description": "National Tsing Hua University is a public institution that traces its roots back to 1911, when it was established in Beijing as Tsing Hua Academy. The school was renamed in 1928 and then relocated to its present site in Hsinchu, Taiwan\u00a0\u2013 around 50 miles southwest of Taipei\u00a0\u2013\u00a0in 1956. Tuition costs at the university\u00a0are the same\u00a0for domestic and international students, though they vary\u00a0by subject, with science and engineering degree programs costing more. The university, government agencies and private organizations provide some scholarships for international students.\u00a0University housing is available, with priority given to foreign students; many faculty members also live on campus.\n\nThe university\u00a0has several colleges \u2013 science, engineering, electrical engineering and computer science, humanities and social sciences, life science, nuclear science and technology management \u2013  and its academic calendar is semester-based. The primary language of instruction is Mandarin, though some of the university's courses are offered in English. A few fully English-taught degree options, including an international MBA in technology management, are also available. Some of National Tsing Hua University's research centers are\u00a0the Nuclear Science and Technology Development Center; the\u00a0Center for Science, Technology and Society; and the\u00a0Center for Energy and Environmental Research. The university has agreements for research, exchange and other joint activities with more than 100 universities around the world, such as Zhejiang University in China, Kyoto University in Japan and the University of California\u2014Berkeley in the U.S.",

It has 11 campuses, eight of which are adjacent to each other and collectively form the main campus area. In a recent year, upward of 21,000 students attended\u00a0National Cheng Kung University, and a little more than half of them studied at the undergraduate level.\u00a0Tuition costs\u00a0vary by subject and\u00a0are higher\u00a0for international students, who can apply for university- and government-sponsored scholarships.\u00a0Housing is available for both undergraduate and graduate students.\n\nThe university has colleges focused on a variety of subjects: liberal arts, sciences, engineering, electrical engineering and computer science, planning and design, management, social science, medicine, and bioscience and biotechnology.\u00a0Its academic calendar is semester-based, and the primary language of instruction is Chinese. However, some\u00a0classes and a\u00a0handful of degree\u00a0programs \u2013 mostly at the graduate level \u2013\u00a0are taught in English. Degree-seeking international students can also take free Chinese language courses. National Cheng Kung University's research centers include the\u00a0University Center for Bioscience and Biotechnology, the\u00a0Research Center for Energy Technology and Strategy, and the\u00a0Medical Device Innovation Center. University researchers were involved in the construction\u00a0of the Formosat-2 satellite, which launched in\u00a02004\u00a0and carried\u00a0the National Cheng Kung University flag into outer space.",

        "Description": "The Indian Institute of Science is a public institution that was founded in 1909. The university is located in the city of\u00a0Bangalore in southern India. In a recent year, upward of 3,000 students attended the university, and the vast majority of them \u2013 89 percent \u2013 studied at the graduate level. The school's relatively new undergraduate program is research-focused. The first class of bachelor\u2019s students graduated from the school in 2015. International students cannot enroll in the undergraduate program, but they can apply to the university's graduate-level programs. However, in a recent year, less than 1 percent of the student body was international. The Indian Institute of Science is a residential school \u2013 nearly all of its\u00a0undergraduate- and graduate-level\u00a0students\u00a0live in on-campus student housing.\n\nThe science- and engineering-focused institution has six academic divisions, each with multiple departments: biological sciences, chemical sciences, electrical sciences, interdisciplinary research, mechanical sciences, and physical and mathematical sciences. The university uses a semester-based academic calendar, and the language of instruction at all levels of study is English. Tuition is the same for domestic and international students.\u00a0All students at the university receive stipends that cover some or all of their tuition and living costs. Federal government grants fund many of these stipends. Among the university\u2019s research centers are the Center for Infrastructure, Sustainable Transportation and Urban Planning, the Divecha Centre for Climate Change and the Centre for Brain Research.",

        "Description": "The Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, also known as IIT Bombay, is a public institution that was founded in 1958. The university is located in Powai, a northern suburb of Mumbai, India, and its campus sits between the Powai and Vihar lakes. It takes\u00a0about an hour to travel by public transportation\u00a0from the IIT Bombay campus to the\u00a0Mumbai city center.\u00a0In a recent year, less than 1 percent of the university\u2019s student body was international. Tuition costs are higher for foreign students. IIT Bombay is a residential institution where all students, as well as many faculty members, live on campus. Housing is guaranteed for all students.\n\nThe science- and technology-focused school has many academic divisions, including departments focused on\u00a0aerospace, chemical, civil, electrical and mechanical engineering. The primary language of instruction at IIT Bombay is English, and the institution\u2019s academic calendar is semester-based. Undergraduates get involved with research at IIT Bombay through the UG Research Awards program, where they can receive stipends to conduct research and earn academic credit for their work. University research centers include the Centre for Research in Nanotechnology and Science, the Centre for Technology Alternatives for Rural Areas and the Centre for Formal Design and Verification of Software. The university has numerous partnerships with institutions in around two dozen countries for student exchanges, joint degree programs and collaborative research work. Examples of these partnerships include a joint doctoral program offered with Monash University in Australia and another offered with the National University of Singapore.",
